# Smitty's research into John Portune's Double Delta Skeleton Slot Antenna
This is my directory of stuff.  Let's see, I've got an OpenSCAD model for the top bracket,
I've got some drawings of the switching network I made, I've got the raw NanoVNA data
I collected...  I might have other stuff too, look at README.md files inside the directories.
