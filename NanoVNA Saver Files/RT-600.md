# RT-600
These are my notes on reverse engineering the [LDG RT-600 remote tuner](https://ldgelectronics.com/index.php/products/remote/rt-600/)

## RF Path
It's a series inductor with a parallel capacitor on either the radio or antenna side of the inductor.

              L

Radio  --- C         Load
       ---
        |

```

```
          L
     ---()()()---+---
                 |
Radio         C ---  Load
                ---
                 |
     ------------+---
```
The "inductor" is actually a switched bank of 7 inductors in series, from 0nH to 12700nH.  Similarly, the capacitor is a switched bank of 7 capacitors in parallel, from 0pF to 1270pF.

### Capacitor Bank
The capacitor shown above is actually a switched bank of 7 capacitors in parallel, from 0pF to 1270pF.  They're all rated at 2kV.

The 7 "capacitors" are:
1. 10pF
1. 20pF
1. 40pF
1. 80pF
1. 160pF
1. 320pF
1. 640pF

Any computer nerd will immediately identify the powers of 2 here.  With these values, you can make any value capacitor from 0pF to 1270pF simply by connecting or disconnecting the capacitors from a parallel bank.  It's a 7 bit number.

#### Improving capacitor ratings:
Each of 7 "capacitors" above are actually 4 capacitors in series.  Each individual capacitor is rated at 500V, so the series is rated at 2000V.  Each individual capacitor's value is 4x the value listed above.  So, for example the "10pF 2kV" capacitor listed above is actually 4x 40pF 500V capacitors in series.  This is only done to improve the voltate ratings of the capacitors, not for any RF reasons.  Everywhere in this document besides this note, we consider the 4-capacitor-series as a single capacitor.  So, we talk about a "switched bank of 7 capacitors."  Yes, that's actually 28 physical capacitors, but we're treating it as only 7.

### Inductor Bank
Similarly, there are 7 inductors in series.  Each individual inductor is some number of turns wrapped around a toroidal core.  I used [toroids.info](http://toroids.info) to calculate the inductance for each of the following:
1. 2 turns, [T106-2](http://toroids.info/T106-2.php): .05uH  (Note this one is a smaller core than all the others.)
1. 4 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): .18uH
1. 6 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): .40uH
1. 9 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): .89uH
1. 12 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): 1.58uH
1. 17 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): 3.18uH
1. 24 turns, [T130-2](http://toroids.info/T130-2.php): 6.34uH

You'll note that those values are awfully close to .1uH, .2uH, .4uH, .8uH, 1.6uH, 3.2uH, and 6.4uH, for a full range of 0nH to 12700nH

## Conclusion
All this means this tuner should be able to tune anything as long as the C and L required are in these ranges.  The "10:1 tuner" is marketting fluff.
